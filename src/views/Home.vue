      Colossus: heavy-duty firefighting excellence:
    </h1>
    <p class="text-left ml-20  text-blue-400">
      The Colossus heavy firefighting robot, developed in collaboration with the
      Paris Fire Brigade (BSPP), is engineered to redefine firefighting
      capabilities in extreme environments. This robust robot excels in critical
      missions such as fire suppression, casualty evacuation, and equipment
      transport. Notably, during the fire at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris,
      Colossus showcased its extraordinary resilience and effectiveness,
      operating under extreme heat conditions for over 10 hours, significantly
      aiding firefighters in protecting the iconic structure. For more
